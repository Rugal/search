##Java
My project using Maven as builder. Maven is just like ant, which is used by "Eclipse". For those who might tend to use "Eclipse", you can still import Maven project in Eclipse as there is an option to import "Maven Project".  
For the Maven java test program, if you need to see the output of test class, please use maven test command. Of course you need to install maven in your PC.   
For netbeans user, there is an embeded maven. So there is no need to install one by you own.  
For eclipse user, please install [m2e](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) plugin.  

    mvn test
